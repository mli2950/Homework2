                      <li>Hi! My name is Michael Li. I was born and raised in Casper, Wyoming. </li>
                      <li>  I have done a few semesters of college. First at Casper Community College in Casper. I then transferred to Colorado Mesa University in Grand Junction, Colorado for 2 semesters. After that, I moved around with Asher's mother. We lived briefly in Gillete, Wyoming and Thornton, Colorado.We are now back in her hometown of Sheridan, Wyoming.</li>
                      <li>Throughout the last couple years, I have done several interesting jobs. I worked for a railroad company that did track maintenance in coal mines, I worked for a warehouse, and I worked for a towing company operating heavy medium and small wreckers, as well as rollback tow trucks (The trucks with the long flat bed that tilts and carries cars).That was a very interesting job. I am attenidng this coding bootcamp for several reasons. Firstly, I have always had a passion for computers and understanding how they work, as well as creating things. Secondly, I intend to finish my degree in Computer Science eventually. I am hoping to find a SWE related job with the knowledge I gain, to get out of the manual labor field.</li></ul></p>
